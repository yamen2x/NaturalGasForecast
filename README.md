# NaturalGasForecast
This project forecasts natural gas prices using the Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) time series model.
## Overview
The aim of this project is to explore and model historical natural gas prices to forecast future trends using time series techniques. It walks through the complete SARIMA pipeline â€” from data preprocessing to model deployment.
## Features
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handle missing values and prepare data for modeling  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize trends, seasonality, and stationarity  
- Model Identification: Choose optimal (p, d, q)(P, D, Q, s) parameters using AIC/BIC  
- SARIMA Modeling: Train a seasonal ARIMA model using `statsmodels`  
- Forecasting: Generate future predictions with confidence intervals  
- Evaluation: Plot forecasts, analyze residuals, and assess model performance
